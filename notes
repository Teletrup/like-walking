learn to do it right
  1000 streak

comfortable to do stuff right

no backspace

to avoid metricization

just feedback, no incentive other than more stuff to learn

timeout
  punishes sloppiness
  prevents not actually practicing
  suppresses brute force instinct

"lemme fix it real quick"

augmented feedback
  nope

wyżej wała nie podskoczysz

don't put restrictions on the art of practicing

skills
  counting objects
  addition
    n digit
    n number
  different bases
  subtraction
  multiplication
  decimal point
  fractions
  base conversion
  guesstimates
adjustable

only restrict the user to the right results
  entering the correct answer with backspace is not the right result

this stuff is easy to write using as many frameworks/languages as possible
yet it 

no context skills

infinite draggable area?
  too fancy

the more you tweak the experience, the less useful it becomes
  rly?

perfect validation?
  only rejection
    1 and 10 start the same

editor 

backspace vs timeout 

multiple good answers?
  sure

this app doesn't train the ability to self-assess
  or maybe it does by setting high standards for success

I'm better at walking than at breathing

having a record score makes me careful

room to do it meta-wrong
just make a lot of tasks that are mutually confusing

transferability
mutual confusion

provisional skill
  what to watch out for

overlearning
  as I did with my phone PIN?
  that's why you move to another tasks


should I try coding without notes again?
maybe it's good in general to practice doing something without the cool tool I rely on

adding component
deleting component

failure at compression

pushing a branch

==================================================
;PREACT


children

stuff.id?

lifecycle stuff
  doing it with hooks?

move to frontcomp?

passing description
  a tag?

make a repo for notes?

analyzing htm
  weird template stuff
  read the code
  props without ${}

initializing reducer with props

let's go with tree view first

leaves are collapsible too

tree view
  button and title
  open/closed state
  displays children in a slightly indented div

how inline-block display works anyway?

collapsing clears state

use underscore font?

constant init props
  some lifecycle thingy?
  reducer?

answer buffer & key action?

answer closure

==================================================
;UNCATEGORIZED

monospaced font?

no button?

initialize leaf with an object
